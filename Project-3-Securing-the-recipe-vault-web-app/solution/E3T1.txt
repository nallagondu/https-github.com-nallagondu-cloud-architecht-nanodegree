Based on the documentation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_unauthorized.html#unauthorized9) provided by GuardDuty for sshBruteForce, it describes that if the attack is performed using victims instances then the severity is high, which makes sense as well. Also, this attack is only detected when port 22 is used for ssh, if ssh is configured on some other port, this attack type is not detected.
